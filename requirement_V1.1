User:
F1.1 Basic Depend on F2.1
Input basic data of building(totalFloor, totalLift)
System must allow user to input the total floors number and the range of total lift number

F1.2 Basic Depend on F2.1
Input basic data of lift(capacity, time_PsgInOut, time_OpenClose, time_FloorToFloor)
System must allow user to input the details of lift. What is the capacity, how long does the passenger need to enter the lift from outside lift, how long does the lift door open from close, how long does the lift door close from open and how long does the lift move from one floor to neighbor floor.

F1.3 Basic Depend on F2.1
Input simulation data (simTime)
	System must allow user to input how long the simulation needs to simulate.

F1.4 Basic Depend on F2.1
Input special events(type, startTime, endTime,fromFloor/toFloor,demandPsg)
	System must allow user to input some traffic pattern. What type does the traffic happen(weekend or weekday), when does the traffic start, when does the traffic end, what is the traffic floor and the demand number of passenger.
