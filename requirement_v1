input basic data of building(totalFloor)
input basic data of lift(totalLift, capacity, time_PsgInOut, time_OpenClose, time_FloorToFloor)
input simulation data(simTime)
input special events(type, startTime, endTime,fromFloor/toFloor,demandPsg)



show form(building,lift, sim data, traffic pattern)

random traffic pattern based on events

sort psgQ into upQ and downQ by their direction

calculate avgTime

calculate avgLength

calculate percentBusy

simulate time (start from 0, stop when the simulation reaches the goal)
